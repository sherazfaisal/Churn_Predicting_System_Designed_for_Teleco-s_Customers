# Churn_Predicting_System_Designed_for_Teleco-s_Customers
We have designed the churn predicting system for the Telco's Customers using the dataset. This dataset has all the required information about the customers. We have
performed preprocessing and encoding before getting into the exploratory analysis. Here is what we managed to analyse from the customer information data.

We have applied and compared the accuracy the following types of models:
1. Logistic Regresser (80.05% accuracy)
2. Random Forest Classifier (79.9 % accuracy)
3. Support Vector Classifier (78.9% accuracy)
4. ADA Boost Classifier (79.9% accuracy)

We have found out the features affecting churn most in Logistic Regresser and Random Forest Classifier. Here is the sneak peak.
